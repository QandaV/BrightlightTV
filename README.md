Analysis of Viewership behaviour trends
To enhance the value of the analysis and further demonstrate technical competencies, the following extensions were implemented;

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Enhancements
Applied advanced filtering in SQL to exclude incomplete records (e.g., missing viewing_times or duration2) to ensure the reliability of insights.

Derived Fields for Deeper Insight
Introduced calculated fields such as Activity_Status, custom time-of-day segments (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Late Night), and user age brackets using SQL CASE statements.

Integrated Multi-Tool Workflow
Utilized Excel for initial exploration and visualization, Snowflake for data modeling and querying, Power BI for interactive dashboards, and Miro for planning and ideation.

Scalability in Mind
SQL scripts were written in a modular format to allow for future automation, replication across different time periods, or expansion into other KPIs (e.g., churn, content segmentation, etc.).

Recommendations Grounded in Data
Visual insights directly informed strategic recommendations on content scheduling and audience targeting, supporting BrightTVâ€™s goal of increasing daily engagement and subscriber growth.
